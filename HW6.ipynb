    "The homework is automatically checked. There are some strict guidelines, which are explained below, including some other information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first code cell contains a function - `student()` - in which you have to fill in your name, student number and e-mail. Please do so __correctly__, since these will be used to store and mail your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- All exercises are defined as a function (`def`), of which we will check whether your output of the function corresponds with ours. This means that __we will only check the answer__ (output). So, always check whether your function _returns_ (careful: this is not the same as print) an answer as specified in the exercise!\n",
    "\t- __Do not change the names__ of the given functions, these are specifically named this way for checking the homework. (e.g. if you are to answer exercise 1 which is a function coded: `def exercise1():`, then do not change the name of the function `exercise1()`)\n",
    "\t- __Do not define another new function with the same name__. Even if it is in other cells. We will not be able to find the right version.\n",
    "\t- Do not write additional code in the cell where the function is defined, so only include code within the function that is necessary for the answer. \n",
    "    - After the cell with the function (`def`) a code cell is added where an example of an answer is given to show the format of your output. It also contains a test of your function. You can adjust this to whatever you want (even delete it if you want).\n",
    "\t\n",
    "- Feel free to __add new cells to test snippets of code or for other purposes__.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are no hard deadlines, but 15/100 points are awarded for submitting your work before the due date, which you can find on Brightspace. It will need to pass at least one test at that time in order to earn those 15 points. __You will be able to resubmit your work at any time after that (until January 1, 2021) and earn the remaining 85/100 points__.\n",
    "\n",
    "About your homework results: An _exercise_ is considered to be correct if all its subquestions are answered correctly, however an _exercise_ sometimes undergoes multiple tests (based on different inputs). The e-mail with results specifies per _exercise_ how many tests you have passed. You will get points only for the exercises where you passed all tests.\n",
